            <h1>One Winter Storm Brings Snow to East Idaho While Another One Awaits</h1>

                </h2>
                <img id="wintercabin" src="images/wintercabin.jpg" alt="Cabin Covered in Snow">
                <p>The first of two big Thanksgiving week winter storms entered East Idaho on Wednesday morning and is
                    continuing to bring snow to the region during one of the biggest travel times of the year.</p>

                <p>After the current storm exits the area on Thursday morning, another storm will bring widespread snow
                    to East Idaho on Friday, according to the National Weather Service. Authorities are urging the
                    public to use extreme caution while driving for the Thanksgiving holiday because of the storms.</p>

                <p>Winter storm warnings calling for a foot or more of snow from the first storm have been declared for
                    much of East Idaho, including the Arco, Spencer, Dubois, Island Park, Preston, Malad, Rockland,
                    Malta, Holbrook, Thatcher and Montpelier areas.</p>

                <p>The rest of East Idaho including the Pocatello, American Falls, Aberdeen, Burley, Blackfoot, Fort
                    Hall, Idaho Falls, St. Anthony, Ashton, Driggs, Victor, Palisades, Soda Springs, Lava Hot Springs,
                    Rigby and Rexburg areas are under winter weather advisories.</p>

                <p>The weather service is reporting that the central Idaho mountains are getting hit hard by the first
                    storm. Sun Valley and Hailey each received over 15 inches of snow on Wednesday.</p>

                <p>The first storm didn't dump as much snow as expected on Pocatello on Wednesday. The Gate City
                    received less than an inch of snow, according to the weather service, but lower elevation areas near
                    Blackfoot received 3 to 4 inches of snow.</p>

                <p>The weather service did not yet have any East Idaho higher elevation snowfall totals for the first
                    storm as of Wednesday night.</p>

                <p>More snow is expected to fall on East Idaho on Thursday morning before the first storm exits the
                    region.</p>

                <p>The second storm will dump another round of snow on East Idaho starting Friday morning and continuing
                    through Friday night and possibly into Saturday morning. East Idaho's higher elevations, including
                    Soda Springs and Montpelier, could receive up to 10 inches of snow from this second storm while
                    lower elevations, including Pocatello and Idaho Falls, are predicted to get around 4 inches of snow.
                </p>

                <p>The high winds associated with both storms could cause blowing and drifting snow in East Idaho and
                    road closures are possible.</p>

                <p>Once the second storm exits the region temps are expected to drop this weekend in East Idaho.
                    Nighttime lows could hit zero degrees in East Idaho during the weekend while daytime highs are
                    expected to be in the 20s.</p>

                <p>The winter weather is coming on one of the biggest travel weeks of the year and there has already
                    been one fatal snow-related car crash this week in Idaho.</p>

                <p>On a snow-covered Highway 55 between McCall and Donnelly, Boise resident Kenneth Fourtner, age 27,
                    attempted to pass another vehicle and careened off the east side of the road on Monday night, state
                    police said.</p>

                <p>Fourtner’s 2004 Toyota Tacoma pickup overturned after leaving the highway. He wasn’t wearing a
                    seatbelt and was ejected from the vehicle. Fourtner was transported via ambulance to St. Luke’s
                    McCall Medical Center where he later died, state police said.</p>

                <p>Although the snow hadn’t yet started falling on East Idaho on Tuesday morning, law enforcement
                    agencies in the region were already urging the public to be prepared for the incoming storms.</p>

                <p>The Bonneville County Sheriff’s Office sent a press release Tuesday morning urging motorists to clear
                    the ice and snow from their widows before driving and to travel at a slow speed once the snow starts
                    falling.</p>

                <p>“Year after year our deputies observe motorists who don’t plan enough time in their mornings to
                    adjust for these changes in road conditions that result in slide-offs (and) crashes,” the Sheriff’s
                    Office said in its press release. “A crash is expensive and disruptive enough to your normal daily
                    routine, but can be even more problematic if the crash results in an injury to you or someone else
                    just because you didn’t take time to clear your windows or slow down for slick roads.”</p>

                <p>Idaho law requires vehicle windows to be unobstructed, so any driver who fails to clear the snow and
                    ice from their vehicle’s window can be cited and fined $90, the Sheriff’s Office warned.</p>

                <p>As of Wednesday night, no other winter weather warnings were in effect in Idaho besides the winter
                    storm warnings and winter weather advisories in East Idaho.</p>

                <p>Blizzard warnings, winter storm warnings, winter storm watches and/or winter weather advisories are
                    currently in effect in all of the states surrounding Idaho, so if you’re planning to travel in the
                    region for the Thanksgiving holiday please be prepared for the possibility of dangerous winter
                    weather conditions.</p>
