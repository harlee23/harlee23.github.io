            <div id="templeSummary">
                <p>The Idaho Falls temple was announced on March 3, 1937. In December of the same year 
                    ground was broken and the temple was dedicated on September 23, 1945, by George Albert 
                    Smith. Due to the second World War it took years longer than expected to finish the temple. 
                    It was the 8th temple dedicated and the first in Idaho. It was the first temple to feature 
                    a centeral spire and was designed by architecht John Fetzer Sr. who was inspired by the design 
                    of anchient Nephite temples. The angel Moroni statue wasn't placed on top of the temple until 
                    September 1983. On June 4, 2017 the temple was rededicated following a two year renovation.</p>
