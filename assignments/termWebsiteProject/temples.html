                        March 31, 1982. Ground was broken on December 18 of the same year and the temple 
                        was dedicated on the 25 of May 1984. It was the 27th dedicated temple. Its exterior 
                        is crafted of white granite from China. Its six spire design mimics that of the Salt 
                        Lake City temple, which was built in 1893. Idaho state officials, including the current 
                        Governor John Evan toured the temple during its first open house. The temple later 
                        underwent renovation and was rededicated in May 1987. Then in 2011 the temple had 
                        another major renovation and was dedicated for a third time on November 18, 2012.

                        a centeral spire and was designed by architecht John Fetzer Sr. who was inspired by the design 
                        of anchient Nephite temples. The angel Moroni statue wasn't placed on top of the temple until 
                        September 1983. On June 4, 2017 the temple was rededicated following a two year renovation.</p>
