            <h2>Proximity</h2>

            <p>This website has great proximity between the various elements 
                (text, images and icons etc.). The even sized colored images 
                break up the white background where the type is.  The website 
                also has great negative space, which enhances the proximity. 
                For example, the negative space between the images/icons and 
                the text help the viewer group the three lines of text together 
                and the images (which include text) separately.</p>
            <h2>Alignment</h2>

            <img src="assignments/lesson-2/images/studioMcgee.jpeg" alt= "Studio McGee Website">
            <p>The Studio McGee mobile website is simple, but uses very 
                effective alignment, which is also supported by great repetition. 
                The logo, text and images are all center aligned down the page. 
                The Studio McGee website, like the Roolee website also uses great 
                negative space, which makes the alignment and repetition even more 
                apparent.</p>
            <h2>Repetition</h2>
            <p>Weight Watchers<br>
            https://www.weightwatchers.com/us/</p>
            <img src="assignments/lesson-2/images/weightWatchers.jpeg" alt= "Weight Watchers Website">
            <p>The Weight Watchers website uses great repetition in a variety of 
                ways. The first examples of repetition are the white boxes which 
                are displaying the program options. They are obviously both white 
                rectangles with images cropped to circles, bold titles, and blue 
                hyperlinks, which are both left aligned. The text is all the same 
                typeface as well and there is a cohesive color scheme which helps 
                the flow of the website. </p>
